/**
 * @typedef {Object} MatchHelper
 * This factors out only the parts specific to each kind of Matcher. It is
 * encapsulated, and its methods can make the stated unchecker assumptions
 * enforced by the common calling logic.
 *
 * @property {(allegedPayload: Passable,
 *             check?: Checker
 * ) => boolean} checkIsMatcherPayload
 * Assumes this is the payload of a CopyTagged with the corresponding
 * matchTag. Is this a valid payload for a Matcher with that tag?
 *
 * @property {(specimen: Passable,
 *             matcherPayload: Passable,
 *             check?: Checker
 * ) => boolean} checkMatches
 * Assuming a valid Matcher of this type with `matcherPayload` as its
 * payload, does this specimen match that Matcher?
 *
 * @property {(payload: Passable) => RankCover} getRankCover
 * Assumes this is the payload of a CopyTagged with the corresponding
 * matchTag. Return a RankCover to bound from below and above,
 * in rank order, all possible Passables that would match this Matcher.
 * The left element must be before or the same rank as any possible
 * matching specimen. The right element must be after or the same
 * rank as any possible matching specimen.
